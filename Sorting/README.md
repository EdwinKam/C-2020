# Sort
This program can implement different types of sort and display their counts of moves and compares.

## DESIGN.pdf
- Answered Pre-Lab questions
- Explain the pursuedo code that provide in the lab manual
- Try to explain how to implement those functions into my program
## Makefile
- edited the Makefile from assignment 4
- command make will create an execuable file and a -o file.
- command make clean will clear everything generated by Makefile
- command make infer and make valgrind will check memory allocaiton
- make valgrind will call make and ./valgrind ./sorting -A

## sorting.c
### main
- take user input -s -b -q -i will call each sorting method
- -p -r -n will take arguement from user will are array size, random seed and how many element to be displayed
- take arguement from the command prompt
- if we invalid arguement inputted, error message will be displayed
- edited the switch function from last assignment
- For option, I put "Absqip:r:n:" so the program won't require user to input an arguement everytime after -rn
- call arr_delete at the end to deallocate the memory of the array created.
- Each sorting function created its own array
### Array.c
- struct for our array
- alllocates memory for arrays and deallocates memory when the delete function is called
- Has move and compare variable to keep track on the comparison and movement for each array
### Note
- make infer gives error message for not freeing array memory
- But valgrind checks there is no memory leaks
- I did not free the array within the same scope the array was created so make infer gives error message
- Which is a known bug for make infer
